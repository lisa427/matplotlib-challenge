This Jupyter notebook analyzes data from a pharmaceutical company that is testing cancer treatments on mice.  Over 45 days, mice with tumor growth were treated with different drugs and their tumor volume was measured throughout the study.  The study was set up to compare the drug of interest, Capomulin, with the other treatments.
